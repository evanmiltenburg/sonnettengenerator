# Automatic generation of sonnets

## Subfolders
This project has the following subfolders:
- `resources` provides data extracted from DBNL, Wikipedia, and possible future sources.
- `DBNL-sonnets` shows how to generate sonnets based on data from DBNL.
- `Wikipedia-sonnets` shows how to generate sonnets based on data from Wikipedia.

The latter two also offer more detailed instructions on how to generate sonnets.
There is some duplication between the DBNL and Wikipedia folders. This is intentional.
Separate folders make it easier to either improve the data for a particular source,
or to copy the approach for a new source of text.
